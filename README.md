This is a Python webapp was for a project that had a vet prompt to build a web application that would help them manage their animals and vets (but instead of a vet, I've modelled it after a Pokémon Center).

Requirements:
'''
Flask
SQLAlchemy
postgresql
import (To import the pokédex data using Pokéapi)
'''

Set up:
1. First you need to set up a database called "pokecenter". In postgresql the command will be 'createdb pokecenter'. Go into app.py and on line 7 (app.config) and change the username to yours.
2.
